# Family recipes site

I wanted to learn some React meta-frameworks and found this remix class that builds a recipe site. I have also been collecting family recipes and had been thinking of putting them on a website at some point to make the collection easier to contribute to. I am following along with that class to learn Remix and I will eventually make quite a few modifications to make this fit my own use case.
